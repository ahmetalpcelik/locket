A lightweight image viewer built with Python and Tkinter, offering basic functionality in a minimal, borderless interface. I did this program to see my love while I'm working. 

I will not update it anymore cuz she left me like I'm a piece of trash.

#### Features:
- **Borderless Design**: The application removes the default window decorations for a cleaner look.
- **Drag-and-Drop Window Movement**: Allows users to click and drag anywhere in the window to reposition it.
- **Resizable Display**: Resize the viewer dynamically using the mouse wheel, with proper aspect ratio adjustments.
- **Context Menu**: Access features like selecting an image or closing the application with a right-click menu.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Ensures the loaded image fits perfectly within the current window size.
- **Wide Format Support**: Supports multiple image formats, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP.

#### How to Use:
1. Run the "Run.bat"
2. Right-click and select "Choose Image" to load an image file.
3. Drag the window to move it or use the mouse wheel to resize it.
4. Right-click and select "Close" to exit the application.

#### Dependencies:
- `tkinter` (included with Python)
- `Pillow` (Install via `pip install pillow`)
